\section{Cotangent Space}
\begin{definition}
    Suppose $M$ is a smooth manifolds and $T_pM$ is a tangent space of $M$ at $p \in M$, then \textit{cotangent space} $T^*_pM$ is defined as 
    \[
        T^*_pM = Hom(T_pM; \bb{R}) = \{\ome \mid \ome: T_pM \to \bb{R} \text{ linear}\}.
    \]
    Its element $\ome_p \in T^*_pM$ is called \textit{covector}, one can be written as:
    \[
        \ome_p (v)= a_1dx_1 + a_2 dx_2 + \dots + a_n dx_n.
    \]
