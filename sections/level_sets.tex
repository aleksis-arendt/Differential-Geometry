\section{Level Sets Theorem}
\subsection{Submanifolds}
\begin{definition}
    Let $M^m$ be a smooth manifold, an \textit{embedded submanifold of $M$} is a subset $S \subseteq M$ that is a manifold in the subspace topology, endowed with a smooth structure with respect to which the inclusion $S \to M$ is a smooth embedding.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    If $S$ is an embedded submanifold of $M$, the difference $\dim M - \dim S$ is called the \textit{codimension of $S$ in $M$}. An \textit{embedding hypersurface} is an embedded submanifold of codimension $1$.
\end{definition}
\begin{proposition}
    Suppose $M$ and $N$ are smooth manifolds. For each $p \in N$, the slice $M \times \{p\}$ is an embedded submanifold of $M \times N$ diffeomorphic to $M$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proposition}
    Suppose $M$ is a smooth $m$-manifold without boundary. $N$ is a smooth $n$ manifold, $U \subseteq M$ is open, and $f:U \to N$ is a smooth map. Let $\Gamma(f)\subseteq M \times N$ denote the graph of $f$
    \[
        \Gamma(f) = \{(x,y) \in M \times N \mid x \in U, y = f(x)\}.
    \]
    Then $\Gamma(f)$ is an embedded $m$-dimensional submanifold of $M \times N$.
\end{proposition}
\subsection{Level Sets}
\begin{definition}
    Let $\Phi: M^m \to N^n$ be any map and $c \in N$, we call the set $\Phi^{-1}(c)$ a \textit{level set of $\Phi$}.x
